# Food-Spin
Large Scale Final Project 

Overview:
We are designing an application that will pair multiple users with restaurant recommendations based on prerequisite inputs, such as food allergies, dietary restrictions, interests, and dislikes. The motivation behind this idea is to help alleviate the anxieties that come along with finding places to eat amongst big groups of friends. We believe that we can source data from the Yelp and Google Maps APIs to make this selection based on some formula considering location, cuisine, menu/food selection, restaurant hours, and more. We anticipate using a database to store user profiles which will contain their dietary profile, location, and friends. This will provide functionality to allow friends join a ‘search’ together which will then match them will several ideal options for their next meal. On the front end, we will provide an easy to use and fun interface which will allow the users to spin a wheel to choose a random option amongst those restaurants that fit the aggregated profile of all of the users.

Description for Users:
Food spin is an app that makes group decisions on where to eat fun and easy! Just fill out your location, add filters for food you like, and spin the wheel to get a random restaurant recommendation that meets all of your (and your friends’) requirements. Make quick decisions! In the future, the web application could cooperate with local businesses and be a platform for them to get more exposure; at the same time users could have an easy way to know about new restaurants in town.
